# The AI Smart Module 

_It is designed to analyze solidity contracts and provide recommendations by using Reinforcement Learning Techniques._

## Starting 🚀

_. Below you will find instructions that will allow get a copy of the project to make it work in your own local machine for testing purposes._

Take a look on **Deployment** to know how to deploy the app.


### Pre-requisites 📋

_ Below consider software before installation and how to install it_

```
Example
```

### Installation 🔧

_.  This is how you can build the Flask web application to integrate the reinforcement learning (RL) model._



_1. Set Up the Flask Application_

First, install Flask if you haven't already:

```
pip install flask
```


2. Flask Application Structure
Check the flask directory structure:

```
flask_rl_app/
│
├── app.py
├── static/
│   └── style.css
└── templates/
    └── index.html
```

3. app.py (Main Flask Application)
This file  contains the Flask app and the DQN model logic.

4. index.html (Main HTML Page)
This HTML file provides a simple interface for users to input the smart contract details and get a recommendation.

5. style.css (Optional CSS Styling)
To add some basic styling:

6. Running the Application
Navigate to the directory where app.py is located and run:

Python app.py
Then, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the app.

7. Usage
* Select whether the smart contract is real and if it needs improvement.
* Submit the form to receive a recommendation from the RL model.
This simple Flask application integrates the RL model to provide smart contract recommendations. You can expand this by improving the state representation, adding more sophisticated feature extraction, and refining the recommendation logic.
