**Smart Various** is an AI-powered platform designed to enhance the security and quality of Solidity smart contracts. Utilizing **Reinforcement Learning** and **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**, it analyzes, improves, and strengthens contracts. Key features include preventive security checks, automated corrections, detailed reporting, and a user-friendly interface. The platform supports on-chain data storage and AI model training through the **Hedera** network. It offers a free preliminary self-audit service to help developers address issues early and streamline final professional audits, ensuring the reliability and learning capability of Web3 applications. Stored data is provided in B2B and B2C formats via API and can be utilized as a security solution.

# Problems
As the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets continue to grow, security issues and malicious activities are also on the rise. Phishing, scams, and malicious contract codes are major concerns, especially as they often originate from compromised smart contract code and wallet approvals. In response to this, we propose an AI-powered platform for analyzing, modifying, and improving smart contract codes, providing detailed reports on identified issues and applied fixes.

# Solutions
1. **Security Analysis**: Automatically identifying vulnerabilities and potential security issues in smart contract code, distinguishing between scam contracts and legitimate ones.
2. **Code Enhancement**: Upgrading the code to improve security, efficiency, and compliance with best practices.
3. **Interoperability Conversion**: Converting smart contracts written in one language (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum) to another (e.g., for Hedera Hashgraph) to enable deployment across different blockchain platforms.
4. **Feedback and Reporting**: Providing detailed reports on the issues found, the improvements made, and the rationale behind changes.
