AI-Based Smart Contract Analysis

# Problems
As the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency markets continue to grow, security issues and malicious activities are also on the rise. Phishing, scams, and malicious contract codes are major concerns, especially as they often originate from compromised smart contract code and wallet approvals. In response to this, we propose an AI-powered platform for analyzing, modifying, and improving smart contract codes, providing detailed reports on identified issues and applied fixes.

# Solutions
1. **Security Analysis**: Automatically identifying vulnerabilities and potential security issues in smart contract code, distinguishing between scam contracts and legitimate ones.
2. **Code Enhancement**: Upgrading the code to improve security, efficiency, and compliance with best practices.
3. **Interoperability Conversion**: Converting smart contracts written in one language (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum) to another (e.g., for Hedera Hashgraph) to enable deployment across different blockchain platforms.
4. **Feedback and Reporting**: Providing detailed reports on the issues found, the improvements made, and the rationale behind changes.
